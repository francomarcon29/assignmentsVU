    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This is a website in which the user can find three main sections: navbar, body, and footer. First, the navbar sections presents a logo and three buttons. Each of them provides accessibility to the key parts of the main body which are the table of phones, specifications, and reviews. Moreover, the main body is formed by several parts, starting with a presentation banner, the table of phones, specifications, reviews, and the team. Diving more into details, the table of phones presents a dynamic functionality, where phones can be uploaded by completing the required fields at the bottom of the table. Therefore, these will be automatically updated in the table. To continue with the layout of the website, the specifications are displayed in four boxes vertically organized that represent different technical insights. After this, the reviews are shown in boxes as well but displayed horizontally. To sum up, the footer is where the information of the website is located, starting with the social media links that redirect to each platform, an embedded google map showing the location of the website “store”, and to conclude, the contact are where the user can email or call.</p>

    <h1>Accessibility highlights</h1>
    <h2>1.1: Text Alternatives</h2>
    <p>We think this guideline is very important to our page because the presence of the images, especially the team images, would be missing completely to someone who can't see the images</p>
    <h2>2.1: Keyboard Accessible</h2>
    <p>This guideline is important because there are (especially in the form) a lot of buttons and text input fields that are core functionalities of the page. Without good keyboard accessibility, these functionalities can not be used by a user that can't use a mouse.</p>
